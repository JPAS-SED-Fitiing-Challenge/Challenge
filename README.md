# Challenge
This repo has all the info needed to build the challenge
(a) Synthetic star formation histories: 
Find attached 3 tables (total_file_z021.dat; total_file_z050.dat; total_file_z090.dat) with the fluxes and their errors for the synthetic star formation histories that we generated.
Fluxes units are erg/s cm^2 A and the format is two lines per galaxy, one with 
the values and the second with the errors . There are measurements in 71 filters (the order 
is listed in filters.dat).
We have generated synthetic spectra with different SFH, metallicities, extinction, and signal-to-noise.
We expect you to give us, as an output: 
(1) Mean age and metallicitiy (weighted with light and mass if possible).
(2) Stellar mass
(3) Extinction

(b) SDSS galaxies
The table table_sdss.galaxies.dat  contains the measurements of the JPLUS and JPAS filters on SDSS spectra. The corresponding redshifts to each galaxy is listed in redshift.dat 
The filters for the SDSS (65 could be measured) are listed in filters.sdss.dat

We have also include the models that we've used to generated the synthetic SFH so you can use the same (remember that we're testing codes not the consequences of using different models, this could be a second step).

Ok, if you have further doubts, please do not hesitate in contacting me (psanchezblazquez@gmail.com)
